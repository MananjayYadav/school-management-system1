                            <h4>Our Campus </h4>
                            <p>At Holy Public Junior School, our campus has been thoughtfully designed to reflect our
                                vision of nurturing young minds through a balanced and holistic learning environment. We
                                believe a school is more than just a place for academics — it is a child’s second home,
                                shaping their values, character, and confidence. Students spend a significant part of
                                their formative years within the school, and the atmosphere around them plays a vital
                                role in their growth.

                                <br>
                                <br>

                                Understanding this deeply, we have built an environment that inspires curiosity,
                                creativity, and all-round development. Every corner of Holy Public Junior School — from
                                classrooms to play areas — is crafted to provide safety, comfort, and opportunities for
                                exploration. Our modern infrastructure supports not only academic excellence but also
                                emotional, physical, and social development, helping each student learn, grow, and
                                shine.

                                <p>Bright, cheerful, and spacious classrooms enable children to stay enthusiastic during
                                    the day and study with sheer focus. Each element in our junior classroom is curated
                                    with the thought of young souls in mind. We ensure that there is proper air
                                    conditioning, ventilation and windows overlooking the greenery outside to keep the
                                    classes illuminated throughout the day. Exuberant and colorful designs empower
                                    students to not laze around and be involved with the teachers and fellow classmates.
                                    Our classrooms have enough seating to incorporate 40 students in each class without
                                    stuffing the space too much.</p>

                                <h4>Senior Classrooms </h4>
                                <p>Our senior classrooms are aesthetically designed to ensure that students from classes
                                    8th to 12th are excited yet motivated to come to class daily. The airy classrooms
                                    have ample natural light, proper air conditioning, and enough space for students to
                                    move around and not feel confined. The classrooms also have bookshelves where
                                    students can keep their books if need be. Unfurling a child's imagination with SWS's
                                    classroom is seamless with the soothing color combination and seating arrangements.
                                    There is also a two-way study mode – one through the traditional whiteboard and one
                                    through the digital panel that help students learn by way of presentations, videos,
                                    case studies, documentaries, and a lot more.

                        <h4>Labs</h4>
                        <p>Our labs allow students to explore various fields of study by implementing theoretical
                            knowledge into practical settings. At SWS, we believe that subjects cannot be solely
                            understood through books, and it is essential for students to apply what they have learned
                            in the classes by experimenting in the labs. In our labs, students learn to use evidence and
                            data to support real issues related to their subjects. From Science, Computers, Social
                            Sciences, Mathematics to English and Robotics – we have a dedicated lab for each subject
                            with the proper equipment, spacious seating, adequate lighting, and fascinating interiors
                            that ensure no study day is a dull day!

                                    across all niches to suit children of all age groups. The Library room is a
                                    well-built, spacious, air-conditioned, ventilated, and supremely lit space so that
                                    each learner can enjoy their time reading the books they want. The room is built
                                    away from the classrooms to ensure that there is no sound or disturbance when
                                    children are busy reading and enjoying the literature of their choice.</p>

                                    healthy, hygienic, and filled with all the nutrition that a budding child needs. We
                                    have a multi-cuisine kitchen that serves high-quality food and enables young
                                    learners to become more mindful, energetic, and focused. The food served in the
                                    canteen is cooked according to the Ayurvedic Diet, where the three doshas are taken
                                    into consideration in order to fulfil each child’s specific food requirements. Our
                                    canteen is the perfect place for students to take a refreshing break and enjoy the
                                    food they love, with proper ventilation as our primary focus. This space is also an
                                    excellent area for students to build friendships and bolster new ones by spending
                                    lovely time with peers.

                    <h4>Sports Room</h4>
                    <p>Physical activities are as important as academic learning. It is a must that each student
                        engages in some game or the other to improve coordination, teamwork, stamina, immunity,and
                        strengthen muscles. Our school facilitates a variety of outdoor and indoor games to cater to
                        each student's interest areas. It helps the kids boost confidence, enhance mental alertness and
                        learn skills like patience, leadership, and more. Sports in education is a crucial front as it
                        also increases the reasoning power of students and provides them with a recreational experience
                        apart from the regular academic routine.

                    <p style="color: #FFFFFF;">Only RO water is supplied inside the school premises to ensure proper
                        health, hygiene, and sanitization of all the students. The washrooms are created according to
                        age groups, and each urinal and wash basin's height is set accordingly. For the preschoolers,
                        the restrooms have a glass door so that each kid can be monitored from outside. The junior
                        school students have urinals and washbasins set at a low height for easy usage. Lastly, the
                        washroom settings for the senior students are set as per regular standards. All the washroom
                        spaces are cleaned regularly throughout the day to ensure an uncontaminated, clean, and
                        germ-free environment.

                                <h4>Artificial Zoo</h4>
                                <p>The school is situated between lush green trees, and to bring children closer to
                                    nature and wildlife, we have an artificial zoo installed. The zoo consists of a
                                    number of artificial animals like elephants, giraffes, lions, and more placed on the
                                    school grounds to give the school a feeling of fauna brought closer. It adds to the
                                    school’s aesthetic with vibrant colors around the school grounds. The students can
                                    spend their time learning more about each animal when on the ground and also enjoy
                                    the forestry feel across the school.</p>

                                <h4>Auditorium </h4>
                                <p>SWS Auditorium is a highly spacious and air-conditioned area that can cater to up to
                                    500 students at once for several school functions and inter-school competitions. The

                                    during hourly long functions/competitions. The auditorium has multiple light
                                    settings, from dim to bright, to fit each occasion accordingly. Students can enjoy
                                    their moment of eminence when performing on our well-built large sized stage with
                                    several spotlights. Indeed, the auditorium can make any student feel like they are
                                    the main character in a movie!

                                <h4>Music and Dance Room</h4>
                                <p>The Music and Dance rooms allow students to explore their talent and rejuvenate
                                    themselves regularly. Dedicated rooms for music and dance are present to cater for
                                    an individual class where dance and music professionals guide students to let
                                    themselves free and enjoy the time at hand. Music enhances a student's learning
                                    abilities, whereas dance increases a child's physical strength, stamina, and
                                    flexibility. This is why SWS focuses as much on these two activities as it does on
                                    its academic front. Both dance and music rooms are well-lit, ventilated, and
                                    air-conditioned to ensure a seamless dance/music routine. They are situated away
                                    from the classrooms to ensure that academic classes are not disturbed at any time.
                                </p>
